## JSON_to_DataFrame

# Challenge
JSON is a common format for sending and requesting data through a REST API and it can offen have multiple dimensions. 
JSON can get very complex and difficult to analyst with common tools that prefer 2 dimension tables like Excel, Power BI, Tableau etc.

# Solution Options
This repository attempts to provide multiple methods to extract JSON Data and convert this data to a DataFrame (two dimensional table with columns and rows).

Various types of JSON files examples will be provided with different structures for holding data (for example, dictionarys, lists, lists within list etc.)
Each JSON file will have functions that will extract the data into a table.
